This bachelor thesis describes the implementation of an Android Framework to access mass storage devices over the USB interface of a smartphone. First we will discuss the basics about USB (ie. interfaces, endpoints and USB On the go) and how we can access USB devices via the official Android API. After that we will go through the USB mass storage class which was designed by the USB-IF to access mobile mass storage like USB pen drives or external HDDs. Important are the bulk-only transfer and the SCSI transparent command set to communicate with mass storage devices. Furthermore we will discuss file systems for accessing directories and files. This thesis focuses on the FAT32 file system from Microsoft, because it is the most popular file system on such devices.

After the theory we will devote us to the implementation of the Framework and an example application. First we will go through our purpose in general. Then we will learn something about the architecture of the framework and the actual implementation. Important parts will be discussed in detail.

Lastly there will be an overview of the test results on various Android devices, a short conclusion and an outlook to future developments. Moreover we will discuss the current status of the framework.
