This bachelor thesis describes the implementation of an Android Framework to access mass storage devices over USB. First we will discuss the basics about USB (ie. interfaces, endpoints and USB on the go) and how we can access USB devices via the official Android API. After that we will go through the USB mass storage class which was designed by the USB foundation to access mobile mass storage like USB sticks or external HDDs. Important here are the bulk only transfer and the SCSI transparent command set to communicate with the mass storage devices. Furthermore we will discuss filesystems to access directorys and files. In detail this will be the FAT32 filesystem from Microsoft, because it is the most popular filesystem on such devices.\\
After the theory we will devote us to the implementation of the Framework and an example application. First we will go through our purpose in general. Then we will learn something about the architecture of the framework and the actual implementation. Moreover we will discuss the current status of the framework. Next we will go through the example application.\\
Lastly there will be an overview about the supported devices and Android versions, a short conclusion and an outlook to future developments.
