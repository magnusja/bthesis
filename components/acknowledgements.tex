Many acknowledgment goes to the operating system chair of the TUM, especially to Prof. Dr. Uwe Baumgarten and Nils Kannengie{\ss}er for the ability to write this thesis and especially to Nils for guiding me. The operating system chair also borrowed me a lot of Android devices to test my work!

I also want to thank Jan Axelson for his book USB Mass Storage\cite{usb_ms_jan}. Without this book the thesis would have been a lot more cumbersome. It was an important resource throughout the hole work.

All people who read, corrected and gave me hints for improvement on this thesis in advance also deserve credit. I want to thank all of them at this place!
